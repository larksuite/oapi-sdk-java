/**
 * Access to read and write files on a hierarchical data store. Most callers should use the {@link
 * #SYSTEM} implementation, which uses the host machine's local file system. Alternate
 * implementations may be used to inject faults (for testing) or to transform stored data (to add
 * encryption, for example).
 *
 * <p>All operations on a file system are racy. For example, guarding a call to {@link #source}
 * with {@link #exists} does not guarantee that {@link FileNotFoundException} will not be thrown.
 * The file may be moved between the two calls!
 *
 * <p>This interface is less ambitious than {@link java.nio.file.FileSystem} introduced in Java 7.
 * It lacks important features like file watching, metadata, permissions, and disk space
 * information. In exchange for these limitations, this interface is easier to implement and works
 * on all versions of Java and Android.
