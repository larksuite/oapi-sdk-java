/**
 * Supplies a stream of bytes. Use this interface to read data from wherever it's located: from the
 * network, storage, or a buffer in memory. Sources may be layered to transform supplied data, such
 * as to decompress, decrypt, or remove protocol framing.
 *
 * <p>Most applications shouldn't operate on a source directly, but rather on a
 * {@link BufferedSource} which is both more efficient and more convenient. Use {@link
 * Okio#buffer(Source)} to wrap any source with a buffer.
 *
 * <p>Sources are easy to test: just use a {@link Buffer} in your tests, and
 * fill it with the data your application is to read.
 *
 * <h3>Comparison with InputStream</h3>
 * This interface is functionally equivalent to {@link java.io.InputStream}.
 *
 * <p>{@code InputStream} requires multiple layers when consumed data is
 * heterogeneous: a {@code DataInputStream} for primitive values, a {@code BufferedInputStream} for
 * buffering, and {@code InputStreamReader} for strings. This class uses {@code BufferedSource} for
 * all of the above.
 *
 * <p>Source avoids the impossible-to-implement {@linkplain
 * java.io.InputStream#available available()} method. Instead callers specify how many bytes they
 * {@link BufferedSource#require require}.
 *
 * <p>Source omits the unsafe-to-compose {@linkplain java.io.InputStream#mark
 * mark and reset} state that's tracked by {@code InputStream}; instead, callers just buffer what
 * they need.
 *
 * <p>When implementing a source, you don't need to worry about the {@linkplain
 * java.io.InputStream#read single-byte read} method that is awkward to implement efficiently and
 * returns one of 257 possible values.
 *
 * <p>And source has a stronger {@code skip} method: {@link BufferedSource#skip}
 * won't return prematurely.
 *
 * <h3>Interop with InputStream</h3>
 * Use {@link Okio#source} to adapt an {@code InputStream} to a source. Use {@link
 * BufferedSource#inputStream} to adapt a source to an {@code InputStream}.
